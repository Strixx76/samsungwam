        There is no official documentation of the API used to control the speakers.
        So to be able to implement new features we need to investigate the API, and do a lot of testing.
        I have developed a GUI tool to make this a bit more easy:
        [pywam API explorer GUI tool](https://github.com/Strixx76/pywam_gui_tool)
        Please take a look at it and think about if you are able to help investigating the API.

            I am willing to help investigate the API if needed to implement the suggested feature.
